### statement and goal of the experiment

To see whether RWs could be done, not that easy. the problem of smaller network is that cannot simulate three or four peaks (since the loss vanish problem)

todo list:
- [x] Generating 100,000 random walk polymers
    - [x] Get four directions input polymers.
    - [x] Get the coordinates from four directions random directions data.
    - [x] Get four directions one hot vector data and save them
    - [ ] three directions （这个有点难，因为它向后走的时候没办法）
- [ ] Get all features of random walk polymer
    - [ ] 
- [ ] Write a smaller network for one hot vector and see what is the
